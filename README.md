🔍 CEX-NetScan Professional

    

Professional Network Security Scanner for Termux, Linux & Windows
Real scanning. No fabricated data. Environment-aware intelligence.

📌 What is CEX-NetScan?

CEX-NetScan is a professional-grade network reconnaissance and security assessment tool built for:

Ethical hackers

Cybersecurity learners

Network administrators

Security researchers


The tool is designed with one strict rule:

> If data cannot be verified, it is not shown.



Unlike many “script scanners” that simulate results, CEX-NetScan only reports what the operating system and network truly allow.

🎯 Core Design Philosophy

❌ What CEX-NetScan Refuses to Do

❌ Fake device discovery

❌ Guess MAC vendors

❌ Simulate open ports

❌ Claim impossible scans on CGNAT/mobile networks

❌ Hide limitations


✅ What CEX-NetScan Guarantees

✅ Real TCP-level scanning

✅ Honest environment detection

✅ Transparent capability limits

✅ Clear accuracy indicators

✅ Ethical-first behavior


> If a scan is not possible, the tool explains why — instead of lying.

🧠 Intelligence-Driven Architecture

CEX-NetScan adapts itself based on:

Operating system

Root / admin privileges

Network type (WiFi, Mobile CGNAT, VPN, Offline)

Available interfaces

Routing visibility


This prevents invalid scans and misleading output.

🚀 Installation Guide

📱 Termux (Android)

pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install python git nmap netdiscover -y
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install requests netifaces
git clone https://github.com/cyberempirex/cex-netscan.git
cd cex-netscan
python cex_netscan.py


---

🐧 Linux

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git nmap netdiscover -y
pip3 install requests netifaces
git clone https://github.com/cyberempirex/cex-netscan.git
cd cex-netscan
python3 cex_netscan.py


---

🪟 Windows

1. Install Python 3.6+


2. Install Nmap


3. Add Nmap to PATH



git clone https://github.com/cyberempirex/cex-netscan.git
cd cex-netscan
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cex_netscan.py


---

🎮 Usage Examples

python cex_netscan.py --quick
python cex_netscan.py --target 192.168.1.1
python cex_netscan.py --ports 1-1000
python cex_netscan.py --no-color


---

⚠️ Platform Limitations (IMPORTANT)

Platform	LAN Discovery	Reason

WiFi	✅	Full LAN visibility
Mobile Data	❌	CGNAT isolation
VPN	⚠️	Depends on routing
